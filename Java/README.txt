WGU C482 is a JavaFX app 
that will ask for user input to add, modify, or delete parts and products. The course did not require the project to save data upon exit, and thus this feature is not included. This project incorporates:

Java + JavaFX
Static data storage
Data modification
Data traversing + searching

Software I builds object-oriented programming expertise and introduces powerful new tools for Java
